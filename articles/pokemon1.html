                <br /><br />Return to the Kanto region and experience a classic Pokémon journey in a completely new way with Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! These two titles were created by GAME FREAK, the developers of Pokémon's core role titles. Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! introduces a new style of game that anyone can enjoy, combined with the fun of collecting Pokémon.<br /><br />Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! they are based on Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition, which was first released in Japan in 1998. These updated versions have been redesigned to take full advantage of Nintendo Switch's unique capabilities. The games also capture the fun of Pokémon GO and its intuitive Pokémon capture mechanics.<br /><br />Become friends with your partner<br /><br />At the beginning of your story, you will meet Pikachu or Eevee, depending on the version of the game you choose. This Pikachu or Eevee will join you as your companion in your adventures, growing together on the journey.<br /><br />Pikachu or Eevee will be with you wherever you go, either hanging from your shoulder or riding on your head. However, do not let your adorable expressions fool you and think that tenderness is all they offer. Your partner will also be a reliable ally in the battle.<br /><br />In addition to determining your first Pokémon partner, there will be some differences in the Pokémon species you encounter and the speed at which you find them depending on whether you choose Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! or Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!<br /><br />Catching is easier<br /><br />The games use the abilities of Nintendo Switch to add new and more accessible ways to experience Pokémon and play in the Pokémon universe. Even those who have never played Pokémon before will be able to plunge directly into Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! They are easily accessible for newcomers to the series, but they are also deep enough to keep veteran coaches in trouble.<br /><br />The practice of trapping Pokémon has changed drastically with respect to previous titles. Now you can use Joy-Con on your Nintendo Switch to launch a Poké Ball at your target with one hand, either by pressing a button or by moving the wrist. With fewer buttons and intuitive action, it has never been so simple.<br /><br />Play Pokémon Together<br /><br />Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! They also have simultaneous games for two players. By sharing one of the Joy-Con controllers with a partner, two players can venture at the same time. Launch Poké Balls when you meet with Pokémon to increase your chances of catching them successfully, or have a friend help you by joining in battles against Coaches in your game.<br /><br />Connecting Pokémon GO<br /><br />There is a deep connection between Pokémon GO and Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee! On the one hand, the Pokémon originally discovered in the Kanto region that you trapped in Pokémon GO can be included in these two new Nintendo Switch games. However, this not all.
